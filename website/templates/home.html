<h1 class ="homepage">Welcome to <b>Sign Buddy!</b><img class = "image1" src="static/images/logo.png" width="80" height="80"><br><br>
Did you know that approximately 70 million ðŸŒŽ people worldwide use some form of sign language ? <br><br>

At Sign Buddy, we aim to help people learn and improve ASL by providing them with fun
and interactive excerises. <br><br>

Here at Sign Buddy, we provide two key features; Buddy translate & Buddy Learn.
<b>Buddy Translate </b>ðŸ¤– provides video translations of English words into ASL. This feature works by quickly scanning a stored dataset of
proccessed videos with little to no wait time. <br><br>

<b>Buddy Learn ðŸ“š </b>is one of our key features that thoroughly scans and outputs what a user is trying to sign. It predicts the sign real time using the help of a trained AI model in 
tensorflow, keras, VGG16 and OpenCV. It then outputs the scanned words to allow the user to generate words and sentences. <br><br>


Future Improvements ðŸš€

<ul>
  <li>Incorporate a larger dataset with more words and sentences to explore</li>
  <li>A reward point system that allows the user to collect points based on the number of exercises they get right</li>
  <li>Provide a tool to communication and entertainment platforms to auto generate captions for users who practice ASL</li>
</ul>
